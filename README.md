NorthStarC2 is an open-source command and control framework developed for penetration testing and red teaming purposes by [Engin Demirbilek](https://twitter.com/Nginthenoob).
<br>
<br>
NorthStar C2 Framework consists of two applications, a server-side GUI web application for managing sessions and a client-side stager to communicate with C2 server.
